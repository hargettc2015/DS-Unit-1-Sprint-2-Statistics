## You

What do you care about?
Traveling

What do you know about?
I know about traveling in the US, I'd like to know more about traveling outside the USA. 

What decisions do you face?
Finding the right data

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Which countries have tougher traveling rules/bans?
2. Trend related to the news
Countries that have banned travel from the USA?

5. Valuable to businesses
Cost of hiring people from another state/how to incorporate a good savings plan.

6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings
Average cost of a trips outide of the USA

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Cost of traveling 
## Examples
People often don't travel, because they think they will never have the money. However, with the proper saving plan, saving to travel can be easy.

What data storytelling example inspires you?
I think I am most inspired by the Traveling one so far, I think it could be beneficial for my portfolio, due to the fact that more statistical data can be shown. 

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
You may find that traveling to some places outside the US may be about as expensive as traveling to some places within the US. 

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Cost of traveling within the United States, vs the cost of traveling out of the United States.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
